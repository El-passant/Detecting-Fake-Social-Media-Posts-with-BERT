Stop Islamization of America.,3
We condemn all those whose behaviours and views run counter to our shared values,3
"Defeat Jihad""",3
"the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead"".",3
"The UK should never become a stage for inflammatory speakers who promote hate.""",3
a striking blow against freedom,3
so-called land of democracy and freedom of speech,3
hair trigger in single-action mode,3
pinned blame for Steinle's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies.,3
"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets,""",3
Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails.,3
Trump is easily manipulated by those around him,3
Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs,3
"As the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president",3
This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,3
has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months,3
Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,3
“You don’t need to be reading this.You need to be reading the Bible.”,3
liberty of conscience is not up for a vote,3
willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor’s head that Manafort never met Assange,3
government-aligned cyberspies,3
the worst school shootings in US history,3
"All of the critics of AL are wrong—every one of them!—because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.",3
And that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow,3
all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven’t consulted the Latin text—,3
But such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.,3
"In a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy",3
"the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.",3
the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate,3
Paddock’s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting,3
This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?,3
seemingly covering up the ISIS connection,3
Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people,3
"According to Loomer, she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock’s car first arrived September 25th.",3
cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation,3
Holocaust Syndrome” of entitlement.,3
"Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.",3
"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism",3
Who can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:,3
"Pope Paul’s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it.",3
"The idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I’d ever heard.It shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept.It was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, “just around the corner”.",3
this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.,3
"…it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the “communal” Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ’s presence in this sacrament.",3
We know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.They are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.,3
will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration.,3
"If the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary, then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant",3
"A dark, impenetrable and “irreversible” winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall",3
why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately,3
we are not being told what actually happened that fateful night.,3
"With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a “move away from sin” is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.",3
"I have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases.",3
"Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “Leviathan Church” and not the Catholic Church?If this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.",3
Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness.,3
"demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics, and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse.",3
I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.,3
"Any Jew who opposes the Occupation — or opposes Zionism itself — knows that feeling of being shunned from the places that are supposed to shelter and nurture you: families, synagogues, community centers, arts organizations,""",3
Trump is in the driver’s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret.,3
"once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs.",3
the communists are going to take over the federal government.,3
They had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.,3
"by seeking continued secrecy, it’s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.",3
because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense,3
the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.,3
Every American owes it to himself to read that manual.,3
to keep some of the CIA’s decades-old JFK’s related assassination records secret from the American people.,3
lone nut former U.S. Marine communist,3
"The islands are grappling with physician shortages, Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff, and widespread disparities in Federal health programs—and that was before hurricane season",3
but more can and should be done to help Americans impacted by these disasters,3
"white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one",3
Dr.David Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind…’,3
know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content,3
First they came for the Jews.And then they came for everyone else,3

im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿,2
