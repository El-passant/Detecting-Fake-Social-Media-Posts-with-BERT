"My extremely close, fun, trusting, platonic friendship with my sister is largely the result of the lust I once felt for her.

I'm a couple of years older than my sister, but we started puberty at about the same time. I had felt sexual attraction to girls since I was a small child, I'm guessing that my natural inhibitions are just lower than the norm. Anyway, when she started developing her body I was attracted to it. Very.

We were comfortable with each other (we soon got along better with each other than any of our other siblings) and she had the innocence of the 10-year-old she was, so I ended up seeing stuff every once in a while. Nip slips, changing with the door open, etc. I was so ashamed and scared, but also desperately pubescently horny. So, I naturally went about things the same way stupid boys do with girls: I treated her like a princess.

Now, she was a bit of a brat growing up, and we treated her like it, so she must have noticed when I started treating her differently. As far as I could (and can) tell, she was appreciative that at least one person in the family enjoyed spending time with her. Wrestling on the couch. Playing video games together. Going to the local pool. I was damn distracted, but still enjoying my time with her. Trying desperately not to be caught in my sneaking glances or be too obvious with my physicality.

It was torturous. The cognitive dissonance between caring about her and what's appropriate in general, and desperately wanting her body, was one of the biggest struggles of my childhood. I remember one night on vacation we slept in the same bed in a hotel room. I stayed up the whole night, all too aware of her beside me. How thin her pajamas were, how easy it would be to stick out my hand and explore, wondering if it would wake her up.

Fortunately, I won this struggle. Nothing happened that night. Shortly afterward, I decided that I needed to get my life back in order (as a thirteen year old, I already felt like my life was a mess) and decided to completely repress any urges or thoughts related to her whatsoever. It took months, and my shame didn't go away for a long time. I honestly have no idea where I got the massive resolve needed.

Now, we're very close, and I never think or feel about her sexually. I suppose on a subconscious level I still know that her body is attractive, but I don't regard it as a prospect any more. We're closer than any of our other family members, to the point that we think almost exactly the same thoughts at the same time (even though our personalities are different in plenty of ways) and have tons of inside jokes. We have so much fun together, and I honestly believe that it was largely caused by my childhood maneuverings.

Nowadays, I'm almost exclusively attracted to women of other ethnicity (my first few girlfriends probably had a lot to do with that), which I'm convinced helps; however, as an adult, I've discovered with a bit of fear and disgust that I also have somewhat of an attraction to girls the age she was when this started (9+, barely starting puberty). It's not as strong as attraction to women my age, however, and I'm not worried at all. I talked to a therapist a bit about that part just to be sure that all is well; despite some weird challenges along the way, all certainly is well. I've honestly never spoken of this as far as I can remember, and I had the urge to get it off my chest just recently, so thank you all for listening.

"I'm a corporate lawyer, so maybe this doesn't apply to me. But I honestly don't have any moral qualms about my job. I answer questions from companies about how to comply with the law, I draw up contracts and other legal documents, and when the company is sued I help present its arguments before the court.

A lot of people think lawyers are immoral when they defend corporations, but I disagree. (1) Regardless of who's right, it's simply not a fair trial if the party being sued for millions of dollars is denied access to legal advice and representation. (2) Companies are in the right more often than you'd think. We get a lot of ridiculous lawsuits from individuals obviously after the company's deep pockets. (3) Many lawsuits boil down to simple misunderstandings between companies about contract terms, and 9x out of 10 we end up settling out of court once the parties come to an agreement.

tl;dr: I sleep well at night.

"FOIA request filed for photographs and/or documents related to a vandalism incident on the CSU Sacramento campus came back with no responsive documents.

This incident is mentioned here. Taken from (https://www.coldcase-earons.com/27.php)

11-7-77: 5:40 p.m.
LE received a call from Sergeant Ortiz of the California State Campus Police regarding a note written on the bathroom wall in a campus restroom. The note, according to Ortiz, concerned information about the East Area Rapist. At 6:10 p.m., LE met with Ortiz in the library at the University. The men's room located on the main floor of the building, in the middle stall on the right hand side, written in pencil, was a message which stated, ""The East Side Rapist was here / Will rape my first black girl tonight / Dumb cops will never find me."" They photographed the message.

I still believe that the release of documents related Tom EARs is possible via FOIA requests. It would be interesting if someone has a list of all EARS related FOIA requests ever filed. I would think something like a request for only specific documents (even if only tangentially related to the case) could succeed in getting additional documents released. ",3

I took a look at the YouTube and Google Plus accounts, and quickly found what I believe to be the name, home address, financial status, and place of employment of the person who posted the message. I passed the information onto LE in Oklahoma and in Washington State. ",3

"Spider-Man not only because he's relatable, but because he's full of interesting dichotomies that people often overlook. He's one of the only superheroes with dual classic origins. It was common during the Gold and Silver Ages for characters to be bestowed with powers via some outside accident (Flash/Hulk) or to become exceptional through their own brilliance and ingenuity (Batman/Iron Man). Both of these play an important part in Spider-Man's origin. He gets bitten by the radioactive spider, but without his brilliance in science, he couldn't create the webshooters, an iconic and essential part of his power set. As originally conceived, he's just as responsible for becoming Spider-Man as the accident is. The organic webshooters from the Raimi films completely eliminates this unique aspect of the character and his origins.

He's a nerd and he's not. Most people with only peripheral familiarity with the character think he's always the stereotypical nerd (glasses/always picked on etc) but, although he starts out this way, the character quickly evolves out of this phase (as one realistically would after gaining exceptional powers). The most recognizable version (to comic fans) comes from an era in which the character is social and juggles romantic interests (Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane, Felicia Hardy...) and his failures in these areas stem from his crime-fighting responsibilities getting in the way of his normal life not because he's the perpetual nerd.

The tragedy of his origin also makes for one of the most justifiable reasons to do what he does. Like Batman, Spider-Man puts on the mask because of the murder of a loved one, but unlike Batman, he is partially responsible for the events leading to Ben's death. Bruce Wayne starts on his path after his parents' death, but there was nothing he could do to prevent it. Peter had all the power and opportunity to prevent his Uncle's death but refused to stop a criminal out of selfishness. It's this guilt that drives him not just the tragedy.

Spider-Man is not relatable because he's an everyman. Between his powers and his intellect, he's anything but. What's interesting about the character is that he's so relatable despite not being an everyman.

But that is not a common thing. In some places bartenders prepare drinks strictly in the order that was made by orders. That happens in large bars usually because it's hard to remember everything when you distract yourself. So in this kind of places the best way to get your drink is to wait calmly.

This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.﻿",0

If you found out you were going to die tomorrow would you be happy with what you’ve accomplished or would you regret not doing certain things? Sorry for spamming I’m just trying to motivate people to do the things they’ve always wanted to. If you’re bored come see what I’ve done so far! Almost 1000 subscribers and I just started!,1

im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿,2
