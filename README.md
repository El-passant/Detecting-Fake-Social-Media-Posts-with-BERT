# Detecting-Fake-Social-Media-Posts-with-BERT


The link to the google Colab is at the top of the python file, upload the test and train datasets there and the rest should be fairly straightforward. I tried uploading the finished model but it is around half a gigabyte which is too big for github so you'll have to do it yourself. It took me a few hours to train using T4 so it shouldn't be too bad. Good luck!
